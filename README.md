# ML-Practice-RFDT
A practice repo for me to work on random forest machine learning, and experiment with some new ML concepts

# Dependencies:
- python 3.8.10
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- react 18.2

# Getting started
WIP

## MVP
A frontend application that leverages a trained RF model to recommend books given a book description

### Functional Requirements
* ML Model has manual training ability
* ML model is RF based and contains a large dataset for best accuracy
* ML model follows best-practice principles regarding Reinforcement Learning
  
### Non-Functional Requirements
* User has access to a UI where they can input their book description
* User can input a book title, author, and ISBN to cross and match directly via the existing dataset
* User will recieve 5 recommendations based on their book input
